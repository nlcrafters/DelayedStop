* The big cleanup has started: 
  - Moved some methods from main class to seperate classfiles
0.16 
* Added configurable interval messages
  default value now is: 10m,5m,1m,30s,10s,5s
  This means, at 10 ,5 and one minute, at 30,10 and 5 seconds there will be a message.
  You can use <number>m for minutes, or just <number> or <number>s for seconds
0.15 
* Removed debug message (msg every second) 
0.14 
* Added pause / resume|go command 
0.13 
* Changed timer setup. 
  Using a time-plugin (like proper-time) caused the countdown to behave strangly. 
  The timer now is not connected to 'server-ticks' but to real time.
* Added more variable messages (different text for 1 second / 2 seconds)
  Remove your config.yml and let the plugin re-create it for all options
* Added additional text for broadcasting reason of restart. 
  /dstop 10 Installation new plugin results in :  
  "The server will restart in 30 seconds (Installation new plugin)"

[ADMN] DelayedStop v0.12 - stop the server in x seconds, and inform your players [556]
================================================================================

DelayedStop - As admin you sometimes need to restart your server to get plugins working
              properly. As your server is always crowded with players, you want to 
              announce this restarts a few minutes before you actually do it.
              
              This plugins lets you stop your server in x seconds. 
              Every minute, and under the minute every 10 seconds, the planned restart
              is announced as broadcast, so you can sit back and wait untill the server stops
              automatically.
